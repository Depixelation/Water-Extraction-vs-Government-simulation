## Scenario: 
You own a water extraction and delivery company. You extract water into tanks and sell them to customers to make a profit. However, the government has passed anti-hoarding legislation, limiting the amount of unsold water you can have to some amount, C.

The rate of your water extraction is based on the number N of active tanks you have, where the tanks all have the same extraction rate, r, in C per day per tank. 

Your tanks have unlimited capacity; however, the moment your total unsold water hits the cap C, you must sell some number of tanks to continue extraction. When you sell water, you must send your tank off for delivery to your primary customer, which is D days round-trip away, during which time that tank will not be available for extraction, but will also not contribute to your total unsold water. 

Now, you are wondering about the rate of water sale for different configurations of N, r, and D, as well as how to maximize efficiency by changing the number n of tanks to deliver whenever your total unsold water reaches the cap. 

This simulation simulates these combinations of N, r, D and n over time to determine the rate of water sale for each.
